      <p>This license is a modified version of the GNU General Public Licen=
se
        copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free   Software Foundation, Inc. made with
  their      permission. Section 2(d) has been added to cover use of softwa=
re
  over  a  computer  network.<br>
      <br>
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim=
=20
copies    of  this   license   document, but changing it is not allowed.<br=
>
      <br>
      <big>Preamble</big><br>
      <br>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take awa=
y
  your   freedom     to  share and change it. By contrast, the Affero Gener=
al
  Public   License   is intended  to  guarantee your freedom to share and
change  free   software--to    make sure  the  software is free for all its
users.  This  Public License  applies  to most  of  Affero's software and
to any other program whose authors  commit  to using  it. (Some other Affer=
o
software  is covered by the GNU Library  General  Public  License instead.)
You can  apply it to your programs, too.<br>
      <br>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to fre=
edom,
    not   price.    This General Public License is designed to make sure
that     you have  the freedom to  distribute copies of free software (and
charge    for this service  if you wish),  that you receive source code or
can get   it if you want it,  that you can change  the software or use piec=
es
of it   in new free programs;  and that you know you can do these things.<b=
r>
      <br>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that   forbid    anyone    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surren=
der=20
the  rights.    These restrictions    translate to certain responsibilities=
=20
for  you if you   distribute copies of   the software, or if you modify it.=
<br>
      <br>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program=
,
  whether     gratis    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the
 rights that    you have.   You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source    code. And   you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.<br>
      <br>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright
the   software,      and   (2)  offer you this license which gives you lega=
l
permission   to  copy,    distribute    and/or modify the software.<br>
      <br>
                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want
to  make   certain     that   everyone understands that there is no warrant=
y=20
for this   free software.     If   the software is modified by someone else=
=20
and passed   on, we want its    recipients   to know that what they have is
not the original,   so that any    problems introduced   by others will not
reflect on the original   authors'    reputations.<br>
      <br>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by=
=20
software     patents.     We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors=
=20
of a free  program   will  individually   obtain patent licenses, in effect=
=20
making the  program   proprietary.  To prevent   this, we have made it clea=
r=20
that any  patent must   be licensed  for everyone's   free use or not licen=
sed
 at all.<br>
      <br>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribut=
ion
   and   modification      follow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATIO=
N</b><br>
      <br>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work
which    contains     a  notice  placed by the copyright holder saying it
may be  distributed   under    the terms  of this Affero General Public Lic=
ense.
The "Program",   below,  refers to any such program  or work, and a "work
based on the Program"   means  either  the Program or any  derivative work
under copyright law: that  is to say, a work containing the  Program or a
portion of it, either verbatim   or with modifications and/or translated
into another language. (Hereinafter,    translation is included without lim=
itation
in the term "modification".)   Each  licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
      <br>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modific=
ation
    are   not   covered   by this License; they are outside its scope. The
 act   of running    the Program   is not restricted, and the output from
the Program   is covered    only if its   contents constitute a work based
on the Program   (independent    of having been   made by running the Progr=
am).
  Whether that   is true depends    on what the Program   does.<br>
      <br>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the=
=20
Program's      source    code  as you receive it, in any medium, provided=
=20
that you conspicuously       and  appropriately  publish on each copy an ap=
propriate
copyright notice      and disclaimer  of warranty;  keep intact all the not=
ices
that refer to   this  License and to the absence  of any warranty; and give
any other recipients     of the Program  a copy of this  License along with
the Program.<br>
      <br>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferri=
ng=20
  a  copy,    and   you  may at your option offer warranty protection in ex=
change
   for  a  fee.<br>
      <br>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program
or  any   portion     of  it,  thus forming a work based on the Program,
and copy and  distribute     such  modifications  or work under the terms
of Section 1 above, provided     that you also meet all  of these condition=
s:<br>
      <br>
                        * a) You must cause the modified files=20
  to  carry    prominent    notices stating that you changed the files and=
=20
 the date of  any  change.<br>
      <br>
                        * b) You must cause any work that
you   distribute      or  publish,  that in whole or in part contains or
is derived   from the   Program    or any part  thereof, to be licensed as
a whole at  no charge to  all third    parties under  the terms of this Lic=
ense.<br>
      <br>
                        * c) If the modified program normally
  reads    commands     interactively when run, you must cause it, when sta=
rted
  running    for such    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print
  or display    an announcement    including an appropriate copyright notic=
e
  and a notice    that there is no  warranty  (or else, saying that you pro=
vide
  a warranty)    and that users may  redistribute   the program under these
  conditions, and   telling the user how  to view a copy   of this License.
  (Exception: if the   Program itself is interactive  but does   not normal=
ly
  print such an announcement,   your work based on the  Program is  not req=
uired
  to print  an announcement.)<br>
      <br>
                        * d) If the Program as you received
 it  is  intended     to  interact with users through a computer network
and  if,  in  the version     you  received, any user interacting with the
Program   was given the opportunity       to request transmission to that
user of the  Program's  complete source   code,    you must not remove that
facility from  your modified  version of  the Program    or work based on
the Program, and  must offer an  equivalent  opportunity for   all users
interacting with your  Program through  a computer  network to request =20
immediate transmission  by HTTP of the complete  source  code of your modif=
ied
  version or other  derivative work.<br>
      <br>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whol=
e.=20
  If  identifiable       sections of that work are not derived from the Pro=
gram,
    and can be reasonably       considered independent and separate works
in   themselves, then this License,       and its terms, do not apply to
those   sections when you distribute them    as   separate works. But when
you distribute   the same sections as part of   a whole   which is a work
based on the Program,   the distribution of the whole   must  be on the ter=
ms
of this License, whose   permissions for other licensees   extend   to the
entire whole, and thus  to each and every part regardless  of who wrote=20
 it.<br>
      <br>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rig=
hts
   or  contest     your  rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
the    intent  is to  exercise    the right to control the distribution of
derivative    or  collective  works  based  on the Program.<br>
      <br>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based=
=20
 on  the   Program     with  the Program (or with a work based on the Progr=
am)
   on a  volume of  a  storage  or distribution medium does not bring the
other   work  under the  scope  of this  License.<br>
      <br>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work=
=20
based    on  it,   under    Section 2) in object code or executable form un=
der
the    terms  of  Sections   1 and 2 above provided that you also do one
of the   following:<br>
      <br>
                        * a) Accompany it with the complete
 corresponding        machine-readable   source code, which must be distrib=
uted
 under the  terms      of Sections 1 and  2 above on a medium customarily
used for software   interchange;     or,<br>
      <br>
                        * b) Accompany it with a written offer,
   valid    for   at  least three years, to give any third party, for a cha=
rge
   no more    than   your  cost of physically performing source distributio=
n,
   a complete    machine-readable     copy of the corresponding source code=
,
   to be distributed    under the terms    of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium   customarily used    for software interchange;     or,<br>
      <br>
                        * c) Accompany it with the information=20
  you   received     as  to the offer to distribute corresponding source co=
de.
  (This   alternative     is  allowed only for noncommercial distribution=
=20
and  only  if you received    the program in object code or executable form=
=20
with  such  an offer, in accord    with Subsection b above.)<br>
      <br>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of
 the   work   for   making   modifications to it. For an executable work,
complete   source   code   means all  the source code for all modules it
contains, plus  any associated    interface   definition files, plus the
scripts used to control compilation    and installation   of the executable=
.
However, as a special exception, the   source code distributed   need not
include anything that is normally distributed   (in either source  or binar=
y
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,  and so on) of  the oper=
ating
 system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompan=
ies
 the executable.<br>
      <br>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made
by  offering     access    to copy from a designated place, then offering
equivalent  access     to copy   the source code from the same place counts
as distribution   of   the  source  code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy   the   source  along  with the object code.<br>
      <br>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
 the   Program     except    as expressly provided under this License. Any
 attempt   otherwise     to copy,   modify, sublicense or distribute the
Program  is  void, and will     automatically   terminate your rights under
this License.   However, parties     who have received   copies, or rights,
from you under   this License will   not  have their licenses   terminated
so long as such   parties remain in full  compliance.<br>
      <br>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since=
=20
you   have   not   signed    it. However, nothing else grants you permissio=
n=20
to   modify   or distribute    the  Program or its derivative works. These=
=20
actions   are  prohibited by law    if you  do not accept this License. The=
refore,=20
 by modifying  or distributing    the Program  (or any work based on the Pr=
ogram),
  you indicate   your acceptance     of this License to do so, and all its
 terms and conditions   for copying,   distributing  or modifying the Progr=
am
 or works based on it.<br>
      <br>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
 based    on  the   Program),   the recipient automatically receives a lice=
nse
 from    the  original   licensor   to copy, distribute or modify the Progr=
am
 subject    to  these terms   and conditions.   You may not impose any furt=
her
 restrictions     on the recipients'   exercise of  the rights granted here=
in.
 You are not    responsible for enforcing   compliance   by third parties
to this License.<br>
      <br>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegati=
on=20
  of  patent    infringement   or for any other reason (not limited to pate=
nt
   issues),  conditions   are imposed   on you (whether by court order, agr=
eement
   or otherwise)  that   contradict the  conditions of this License, they
do   not excuse you  from the  conditions of  this License. If you cannot
distribute   so as to satisfy simultaneously  your  obligations under this
License and   any other pertinent obligations,  then as a consequence you
may not distribute   the Program at all. For example,  if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free   redistribution of the Program    by all tho=
se
who receive copies directly   or indirectly through you, then   the only
way you could satisfy both it  and this License would be to refrain   entir=
ely
from distribution of the Program.<br>
      <br>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenf=
orceable=20
     under    any  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is=
=20
intended     to  apply  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in=
=20
other circumstances.<br>
      <br>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
 infringe     any   patents   or other property right claims or to contest
 validity of   any such   claims;   this section has the sole purpose of
protecting  the  integrity of  the free   software distribution system, whi=
ch
is implemented    by public license  practices.   Many people have made gen=
erous
contributions    to the wide range  of software   distributed through that
system in reliance    on consistent application  of  that system; it is up
to the author/donor   to decide if he or she is willing   to distribute sof=
tware
through any other      system and a licensee cannot impose    that choice.<=
br>
      <br>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what
 is  believed     to  be  a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
      <br>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is res=
tricted
     in  certain    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interface=
s,
    the original copyright   holder who places the Program under this Licen=
se
    may add an explicit geographical   distribution limitation excluding
those     countries, so that distribution is  permitted only in or among
countries    not thus excluded.   In such case, this  License incorporates
the limitation    as if written in  the body of this License.<br>
      <br>
                    9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions
 of  the   Affero    General Public   License from time to time. Such new
versions  will  be similar    in spirit to   the present version, but may
differ in  detail  to address  new  problems or  concerns.<br>
      <br>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
 If  the   Program     specifies  a version number of this License which
applies   to  it and "any    later version",  you have the option of follow=
ing
the  terms  and conditions    either of that version or of any later versio=
n=20
published    by Affero, Inc.   If the Program does not specify a version nu=
mber
of this    License, you may   choose any version ever published by Affero,
Inc.</p>
      <p>You may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this prog=
ram
        under any version of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Pub=
lic
     License   version 3 or higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL
 includes    terms   and conditions substantially equivalent to those of
this  license.</p>
      <p>    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
        free programs   whose distribution conditions are different, write
 to   the    author to ask for  permission. For software which is copyright=
ed
  by  Affero,    Inc., write to us;  we sometimes make exceptions for this.
  Our  decision  will  be guided by the  two goals of preserving the free
status    of all derivatives    of our free software  and of promoting the
sharing   and reuse of software   generally.<br>
      <br>
                    NO WARRANTY<br>
      <br>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THE=
RE=20
  IS  NO  WARRANTY     FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICAB=
LE
   LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN   OTHERWISE  STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR   OTHER  PARTIES PROVIDE  THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND,   EITHER  EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED   WARRANTIES  OF MERCHANTABILITY   AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE   ENTIRE RISK  AS TO THE QUALITY AND  PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGR=
AM
IS WITH YOU.   SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,   YOU ASSUME THE COST
OF ALL NECESSARY   SERVICING,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
      <br>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED    TO  IN  WRITING    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY   MODIFY   AND/OR  REDISTRIBUTE    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
BE LIABLE   TO YOU  FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING  ANY  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDEN=
TAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL     DAMAGES ARISING  OUT OF  THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING     BUT NOT LIMITED  TO LOSS  OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR  LOSSES   SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD   PARTIES OR
A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM  TO OPERATE   WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS),  EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY  HAS BEEN ADVISED  OF THE POSSIBILITY  OF  SUCH
DAMAGES.<br>
